    <textOnly>Hi &lt;account team&gt;,


It&apos;s hard to believe, but it has been 6 months since we hosted the  Executive Engagement, and we’d like to check back in to see if you’ve had any wins.


&quot;Wins&quot; can be anything from an increase in revenue, a new deal or test, a pivotal meeting, or even just a piece of positive feedback you heard from your client, but please make sure they are quantified (ex: “upped YouTube budget by $5M for Q4, which is a 50% increase over Q3”,  vs. “increased budget”). You can have a look at our Q3 &apos;20 Quarterly Report for examples of the types of wins we are looking for.


We’d like to format our wins with a headline, a description of the “what,” and the “how”. Here’s an example:


Headline: FTD signs first-ever DVIP (+233% growth), built on Executive Summits momentum


What: The DVIP is for $10M (15M stretch) and includes SVAs tied to Brand Unit Creative Consultation, Display Audience Labs, and Display Ad Effectiveness Studies.


How:  FTD filed for bankruptcy in June, 2019.  A new C-suite team arrived in early 2020.  The account team collaborated with the Executive Summits team to develop a custom, four part Executive Summit Series, anchored in the company’s most important business goals of re-building the FTD and ProFlower brands and covering Video, Display, Customer Experience and Full Funnel Marketing Strategy.  The meetings helped accelerate the DVIP conversations and also led to GMP partner introductions for full One Google platform support.


Please send me a summary of the wins from your summit by &lt;date&gt;, and thank you for helping us track the effectiveness of our summits!
